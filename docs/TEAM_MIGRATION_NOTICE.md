# 📢 IMPORTANT: Repository Consolidation Notice

## 🚨 Action Required: Migration to Super Piper Unified Ecosystem

**Date**: $(date)  
**From**: Development Team  
**To**: All Piper Project Contributors  
**Subject**: Repository Consolidation - Migration Required

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

All Piper repositories have been consolidated into a **single unified ecosystem** to improve collaboration, simplify management, and enhance development efficiency. This is a **mandatory migration** that affects all team members.

## 📋 What's Changing

### Repository Consolidation
- **4 separate repositories** → **1 unified monorepo**
- **Individual deployments** → **Unified deployment pipeline**
- **Scattered documentation** → **Centralized documentation**
- **Cross-repo dependencies** → **Internal package dependencies**

### New Unified Repository
**📍 Primary Repository**: `coltak88/piper-dispatch-newsletter`
**🔗 URL**: https://github.com/coltak88/piper-dispatch-newsletter

### Component Mapping
| Component | Old Repository | New Location | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Newsletter Core | piper-newsletter | `/packages/core/` | ✅ Migrated |
| Dispatch Engine | piper-dispatch | `/packages/dispatch/` | ✅ Migrated |
| Special Kit | piper-dispatch-special-kit | `/packages/special-kit/` | ✅ Migrated |
| API Services | piper-dispatch-newsletter | `/packages/api/` | ✅ Migrated |

## ⚡ Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Update Your Local Development Environment
```bash
# Clone the new unified repository
git clone https://github.com/coltak88/piper-dispatch-newsletter.git
cd piper-dispatch-newsletter

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development environment
npm run dev
```

### 2. Archive Old Repositories
**⚠️ DO NOT** create new issues, pull requests, or commits in the old repositories.

**Archived Repositories:**
- ~~piper-dispatch~~ → **ARCHIVED**
